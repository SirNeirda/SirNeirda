My name is Adrien Pierret, game developer, asset maker and translator currently fond of all things procedural.
I have published the game Wawa United available on Steam and currently working on improving this project while researching on others.

When I happen to create or adapt code I haven't seen anywhere else, I will publish it here hoping it could benefit others the same way I did for my own projects.
